                                1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and

                                stored on ROM cartridges instead of dedicated hardware with games physically built into

                            <p>The Dreamcast is a home video game console released by Sega on November 27, 1998 in
                                Japan,
                                September 9, 1999 in North America, and October 14, 1999 in Europe. It was the first in
                                the
                                sixth generation of video game consoles. The Dreamcast was Sega's final home console,
                                marking the end of the company's 18 years in the console market.</p>
                            <p>Although the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited third-party support, reviewers
                                have
                                considered the console ahead of its time. Its library contains many games considered
                                creative and innovative, including Crazy Taxi, Jet Set Radio and Shenmue, as well as
                                high-quality ports from Sega's NAOMI arcade system board. The Dreamcast was also the
                                first
                                console to include a built-in modem for Internet support and online play.</p>

                            <p>The GameCube is the first Nintendo console to use optical discs as its primary storage
                                medium. The console supports limited online gaming for a small number of games via a
                                GameCube broadband or modem adapter and can connect to a Game Boy Advance with a link

                                which allows players to access exclusive in-game features using the handheld as a second
                                screen and controller. The console was praised for its controller, extensive software
                                library and high-quality games, but was criticized for its exterior design and lack of
                                features.</p>
